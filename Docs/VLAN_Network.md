# VLAN-Segmented Network Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up a secure and organized VLAN-segmented network in a small office or school environment.

---

## üè¢ Overview
VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) segment network traffic into isolated groups, improving performance, organization, and security. This setup is ideal for environments where different departments or device types need separation.

This guide covers the following:
1. Network Components
2. VLAN Configuration Steps
3. Security Best Practices
4. Troubleshooting Tips

## üõ†Ô∏è 1. Network Components
- **Router:** Gateway to the internet and VLAN-aware.
- **Managed Switch:** Supports VLAN configuration and segmentation.
- **Access Point:** Supports VLAN-tagged SSIDs.
- **End Devices:** PCs, laptops, printers, and VoIP phones.

**Network Design:**
```text
Internet --> Router --> Managed Switch --> VLANs:
                                   VLAN 10 (Staff) --> Staff Devices
                                   VLAN 20 (Students) --> Student Devices
                                   VLAN 30 (Guests) --> Guest Wi-Fi
                       --> Access Point --> VLAN SSIDs
```

## üîß 2. VLAN Configuration Steps
1. **Router Configuration:**
   - Enable VLAN support on the router.
   - Assign subnets to each VLAN (e.g., `192.168.10.0/24` for Staff, `192.168.20.0/24` for Students).

2. **Switch Configuration:**
   - Enable VLAN tagging on trunk ports.
   - Assign ports to specific VLANs:
     - VLAN 10: Staff devices
     - VLAN 20: Student devices
     - VLAN 30: Guest devices

3. **Access Point Setup:**
   - Create separate SSIDs for each VLAN.
   - Tag each SSID with the corresponding VLAN ID.

4. **IP Configuration:**
   - Enable DHCP on the router for each VLAN subnet.
   - Assign static IPs for critical devices (e.g., printers).

## üîí 3. Security Best Practices
- **VLAN Isolation:** Ensure devices in different VLANs cannot communicate unless explicitly allowed.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Restrict traffic between VLANs.
- **Port Security:** Limit the number of MAC addresses per port.
- **Firewall Rules:** Block unauthorized access between VLANs.
- **Firmware Updates:** Keep router, switch, and access point firmware up to date.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è 4. Troubleshooting Tips
- **No Internet:** Ensure the router supports VLAN trunking and DHCP per subnet.
- **VLAN Communication Issues:** Verify trunk ports and VLAN assignments.
- **Slow Network:** Check for VLAN misconfigurations and excessive broadcast traffic.
- **IP Conflicts:** Ensure each VLAN has its own subnet range.

## üìÑ Documentation and Backups
- Document VLAN IDs, IP ranges, and switch port assignments.
- Back up switch and router configurations after setup.

This setup ensures a secure, segmented, and efficient network for small office or school environments.
