## üè¢ Overview
A small office network connects multiple devices like desktops, laptops, printers, and VoIP phones while ensuring secure communication and efficient data flow.

This guide covers the following:
1. Network Components
2. Setup Steps
3. Security Best Practices
4. Troubleshooting Tips

## üõ†Ô∏è 1. Network Components
- **Router:** Acts as the gateway to the internet and provides basic firewall functionality.
- **Switch:** Connects multiple wired devices within the office.
- **Access Point (AP):** Provides wireless connectivity.
- **End Devices:** Desktops, laptops, printers, and VoIP phones.

**Network Design:**
```text
Internet --> Router --> Switch --> End Devices (PCs, Printers, VoIP Phones)
                       --> Access Point --> Wireless Devices (Laptops, Smartphones)
```

## üîß 2. Setup Steps
1. **Router Configuration:**
   - Connect the router to the modem using an Ethernet cable.
   - Access the router's admin interface (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
   - Set up the SSID and strong password for Wi-Fi.

2. **Switch Installation:**
   - Connect the switch to the router using an Ethernet cable.
   - Connect wired devices to the switch.

3. **Access Point Setup:**
   - Place the access point in a central location for optimal coverage.
   - Configure a separate SSID for office devices.

4. **Device Connection:**
   - Wired: Desktops, printers, and VoIP phones.
   - Wireless: Laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

5. **IP Configuration:**
   - Enable DHCP on the router for automatic IP assignment.
   - Assign static IPs for critical devices like printers and servers.

## üîí 3. Security Best Practices
- **Change Admin Credentials:** Update default router and switch passwords.
- **Enable WPA3 Encryption:** If unavailable, use WPA2.
- **Guest Network:** Create a separate SSID for visitors.
- **Firewall Rules:** Block unauthorized incoming traffic.
- **MAC Filtering:** Allow only authorized devices to connect.
- **Firmware Updates:** Regularly update the router and switch firmware.

## üõ†Ô∏è 4. Troubleshooting Tips
- **No Internet:** Restart the modem, router, and switch.
- **Slow Network:** Check for bandwidth-heavy devices and interference.
- **Connection Drops:** Update firmware and reposition the access point.
- **IP Conflicts:** Ensure DHCP is enabled with a sufficient address pool.

## üìÑ Documentation and Backups
- Document network settings, including IP ranges, SSIDs, and passwords.
- Back up router and switch configurations if supported.

This setup ensures a secure, organized, and reliable small office network for daily operations.
