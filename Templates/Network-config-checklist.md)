# Network Configuration Checklist

This checklist ensures all essential steps are completed during network setup and configuration.

---

## ✅ 1. Planning and Design
- [ ] Define project scope and requirements.
- [ ] Plan IP address schema and VLAN structure.
- [ ] Identify hardware requirements (router, switch, access points).
- [ ] Create network topology diagram.

---

## 🖧 2. Router Configuration
- [ ] Update router firmware.
- [ ] Change default admin username and password.
- [ ] Set up WAN connection (static, dynamic, or PPPoE).
- [ ] Enable DHCP server for LAN.
- [ ] Configure DNS settings.
- [ ] Set up port forwarding if required.

---

## 🔀 3. Switch Configuration
- [ ] Update switch firmware.
- [ ] Assign static IP for switch management.
- [ ] Configure VLANs and port assignments.
- [ ] Enable trunk ports for inter-VLAN communication.

---

## 📶 4. Wireless Access Point Setup
- [ ] Update AP firmware.
- [ ] Set up SSID and WPA3 encryption (or WPA2 if unavailable).
- [ ] Create guest SSID with client isolation.
- [ ] Enable MAC filtering for authorized devices.

---

## 🔒 5. Security Configuration
- [ ] Enable firewall on the router.
- [ ] Set up Access Control Lists (ACLs).
- [ ] Disable unused ports and services.
- [ ] Enable intrusion detection/prevention (if supported).

---

## 🛠️ 6. IP Addressing and DHCP
- [ ] Assign static IPs for critical devices (servers, printers).
- [ ] Ensure DHCP range avoids static IP assignments.
- [ ] Verify IP address assignment for all devices.

---

## 🔧 7. VPN Configuration (If Required)
- [ ] Configure site-to-site or remote access VPN.
- [ ] Use AES-256 encryption for VPN tunnels.
- [ ] Enable Dead Peer Detection (DPD).

---

## 🔍 8. Testing and Verification
- [ ] Test connectivity between all devices.
- [ ] Verify VLAN isolation and inter-VLAN routing.
- [ ] Check internet access from all endpoints.
- [ ] Test port forwarding and external access.

---

## 📄 9. Documentation and Backup
- [ ] Document IP ranges, VLAN IDs, and SSIDs.
- [ ] Save configuration backups for router and switch.
- [ ] Record device login credentials securely.

---

## 🔄 10. Ongoing Maintenance
- [ ] Schedule regular firmware updates.
- [ ] Monitor network performance and logs.
- [ ] Perform periodic security audits.
